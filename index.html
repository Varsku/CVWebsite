                    <h1>Skills</h1>
                    <p>
                        Currently Tomi's strengths might lie more in backend developement (Java with Spring and Spring Boot), but he doesn't want to stop there. Recently he has added
                        React.js to his skillset and also Node.js, this is only an excersise but done with those 2 skills check it <a href="https://frozen-fortress-88405.herokuapp.com/">Here</a>.
                    <br>
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Tomi also knows HTML and CSS (this site is done with these), but in no means thinks he's a web site designer or anything. If someone does the designing, he can do the implementation.
                        Databases are also quite familiar to Tomi, he's worked with MySQL, mariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and mongoDB
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tomi knows how to use a few tools as well. He has worked with IntelliJ, Eclipse for Java projects. For frontend things and Node the tool of choice has been Visual Studio Code.
                        He can handle database things straight from the command line or use tools like HeidiSQL or JDeveloper
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most used operating systems are Windows and Mac. Linux isn't completely new to him and he has done some server configuring and stuff like that, not every day though.

                    <h1>Tomi's school & career</h1>
                    <p>
                        Tomi is studying information technology in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. He's almost trough with the school, just 3 months of working, few courses
                        and the graduation work and he's done! Tomi started working in HiQ Finlad in January 2018 as a part-time worker. <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work has been mostly maintenance work to clients. Tomi has done error fixing and problem solving, version updates and also developing new features.
                        In this maintenance job he has learned a few new things like Perl and Mason!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have learned a lot in work and the workplace has been great to let me train my skills (like im doing in this site!) and I hope to be a professional in this field some day!

                <h1>Tomi himself!</h1>
                <p>Tomi is 27 years old and lives in Lohja (woop!). He is an easy going guy, who doesn't stress too much. He might be a abit shy at first, but after getting to know
                    people he will start telling jokes and be all smiles! <br></br>
                    Tomi likes to learn new things and has done it quite alot. Resently frontend stuff has really made its way to Tomi's heart and he actually likes to do it! (this was not the case always).
                    These days Tomi has done much more studying and practicing around Node, React, HTML & CSS than with Java and he really likes this stuff. <br></br>
